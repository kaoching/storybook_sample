 * Basic info about Zeplin users.  Zeplin API does not expose any personal information to third-party clients. For this reason, the `email` field is a Zeplin-only alias by default.  You can get the original email addresses of members of your workspace by using a personal access token created with admin rights. Third-party (OAuth) applications are not allowed to access this information.  ☝️*Only organization admins (or higher) can retrieve the original email addresses using an admin token.*
